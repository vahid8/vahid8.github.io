											<h3>Lane detection</h3>
										</header>
										<p>This is a simple lane detector Just using the OPENCV basic functions. It is not the best method but really simple. Also you need to know the exact location of the camera with respect to the Car and its viewing angle to set the ROI (Region of interests). That is done in this example manually as you can see the 4 circles (in the video). The most critical part is extracting of the lines from masked edges using Hough Transform method and filtering the results.
											The results can be improved using more filters but this method is not reliable on itself. I will Upload the other accepted and reliable method in future.</p>

											<h3>Face detection</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Here are the results running 3 different face detectors in Opencv namely Cascade classifier, MTCNN and deep neural network face detector (SSD+ResNet). 
											Cascade classifiers are the older ones in Opencv and less accurate. The other two use deep neural network method with different architecture.
											Although MTCNN shows better result in a scene with lots of faces or faces far from the camera, it fails in detecting complicated faces (e,g with masks) or faces that are much rotated. In those cases the second dnn network has much better performance. 
											In this video I tried to examine different scene to illustrate the results.</p>

											<h3>Object size estimation</h3>
										</header>
										<p>I tried to have different objects on the scene and measure the size of those objects. This can be really helpful in many cases such as quality cheeking in production lines , in logistic industry or in medicament classification by size.
										There are some points regarding this project that I want to mention:
															
											1. The objects are assumed to be in the same depth.
											2. one of the object sizes is given as known (reference object).
											3. beside fitting a square, one can use circle fitting for those objects with the more circle shape form.

											<h3>Camera Calibration</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Camera calibration is one of the fundamental tasks that we need to do before
											every experiment in Computer Vision. This is an overview of my camera calibration GUI written in Python+Tkinter. The K-Matrix and distortion parameters 
											using square chequerboard will be calculated. The important thing is that I can check each image individually to see if the reprojection error is higher than the normal and choose between the images</p>

											<h3>Structure from motion (SFM)</h3>
										</header>
										<p>This video is part of my master thesis, in which I Programmed a structure from motion from Scratch in MATLAB. 
											In this video, you can see the detected features (using Shi-Tomasi feature detector) in frames, camera positions (Visual Odometry)  in 2D and also the created point cloud from only images from above view (in X-Y plane).</p>

											<h3>Scanner</h3>
										</header>
										<p>This video shows the case of using Opencv to extract ROI (region of interest) and coordinate system transformation on this particular region. 
											one of the use cases of such a technique is here for creating a  Scanner !
											another use case is in lane detection method from Ross Kippenbrock, that I will upload it here soon.</p>
