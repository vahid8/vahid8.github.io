                        <p>This is a lane detector using just image processing techniques
                           It is not the best current method but is really simple and fast.
                           Also you need to know the exact location of the camera with respect to
                           the car coordinate system and its viewing angle to set the ROI 
                           (Region of interests). The most critical part is extracting 
                           the lines from masked edges using Hough Transform method and filtering
                           the results. The results can be improved using more
                           filters.

                        </a>
                        <p>Here are the results running 3 different face detectors in
                           Opencv namely Cascade classifier, MTCNN and a opencv dnn that
                           use SSD and ResNet in backbone. Cascade classifiers are the 
                           older ones in Opencv and less accurate. The other two, use deep
                            neural network methods with different architecture.
                            Although MTCNN shows better results in a scene with a lot 
                            of faces or faces far from the camera, it fails in detecting
                            complicated faces ( with masks ) or faces that are much rotated.
                            In those cases the dnn model has much better performance.
                            In this video I tried to examine different scenes to illustrate the 
                            results.

                            Determining object sizes and distances from one image is something intersting !
                            I tried to have different objects on the scene and measure the size of those objects.
                            This can be really helpful in many cases such as quality checking in production lines ,
                            in logistic industry or in medicament classification by size.
                            There are some points regarding this project that I want to mention:
                                                        
                            1. The objects are assumed to be in the same depth.
                            2. One of the object sizes is given as known (reference object).
                            3. Beside fitting a square, one can use circle fitting for those objects with the more circular shape form.

                            Camera calibration is one of the fundamental tasks that we need
                            to do before every experiment in Computer Vision. This is an overview
                            of my camera calibration GUI written in Python+Tkinter. 
                            The K-Matrix and distortion parameters using square chequerboard
                            will be calculated. The important thing is that I can check each
                            image individually to see if the reprojection error is higher than
                            the normal and choose between the images

                        <p>
                            Recently I was on my way back home, that I thought to record a video and test some object 
                            detectors on it. First of all ,I tried Yolo object detector on it. Yolo is a one-stage 
                            detector that does the object detection and classification at one step. It is designed to
                            be used in real time and claimed to be as fast as 45 fps on a single GPU.</p>

                            I used the pre trained model of Mobilenet+SSD for object detection here. This model is claimed to be more accurate than YOLO but slower. Although it was trained on coco dataset, I was not satisfied with the result. So I decreased the confidence threshold to 20 percent. 
                            I think this model should be retrained in case of using for city situations. </p>

                        <p>This is a demo of the project that I coded from scratch in Python. I used images of a calibrated camera and created a Sparse 3D point cloud.
                            No other sensor is used for this project and rather than the point cloud, the camera position can be obtained.                             
                        </p>
